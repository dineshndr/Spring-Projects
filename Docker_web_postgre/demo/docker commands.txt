//steps to interact with docker in real time 


1.need docker client to connect with docker
2.docker is connected to registry.
2. docker contains
   * Daemon - responsible to run container
   * network -config
    * Images
    *containers

Have an API between docker cleitn and daemon and we will interact with daemon to perfrom pull, push and all other operations
